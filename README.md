# appliedMath-chaos

This repository contains equations, definitions and codes regarding the chaos theory. In **IAM-590-Chaos.pptx**, general and basic concepts associated with the chaos theory are given. Details are described in the wiki page: https://github.com/denizkenankilic/appliedMath-chaos/wiki/The-Chaos-Presentation-(IAM-590-Chaos.pptx)-for-Dummies

Currently:
- Lorenz attractor: **lorenz.m, lorenzcode.m**
- Mandelbrot set: **mandelbrot.m**

To do:
- Tutorials, courses and codes about nonlinear dynamical systems will be added
